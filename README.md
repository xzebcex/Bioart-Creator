## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions to improve the code. Contributions to the program are much appreciated. Despite the fact that this program is completely functional, code contributions are always welcome. Fork the repository, make changes or additions to the code, and send a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.

## Additional Points
1.	The animation is created using Python's random and time modules.
2.	The purpose of the program is solely instructive and entertaining.
3.	The pattern for each row in the animation is defined by the ROWS list. The computer chooses nucleotide pairs at random and fills in the gaps in the pattern.
4.	When the user presses ctrl-c, the program gracefully exits using KeyboardInterrupt.

## Conclusion
The Bioart Creator is a simple Python program that utilizes the terminal or command prompt to generate a visual depiction of nucleotide pairs.
